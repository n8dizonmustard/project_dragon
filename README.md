## Next Steps:
The works well when launching this repo locally but not remotely. When I graduate from General Assembly, I'd love to revisit this app to deploy the following updates:
* Fix missing sprites and CSS issues
* Clean up my code
* Reorganize files
* Add sprite animations
* More dragon actions and events
* Include additional weapons/items to choose at the start for more replayability
* Allow user to adjust difficulty
